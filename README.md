# WAF_Challenge_F2017
Wharton Analytics Fellows Data Challenge - Fall 2017

This project was a data challenge for Fall 2017 applicants to the Wharton Analytics Fellows Program at The University of Pennsylvania.
The given loans spreadsheet has a particular loan in question (Loan ID: 73622).
Using the given data, I determined that the firm should not take this loan.

The python script can be run in the same folder as the xlsx file; the graphical outputs and slide deck or included in the outputs folder.
